# Visualizing LASER Polished Data

This project aims at analysing the LASER polished data in the form of images and determine when to stop the projection of LASER onto the surface. The dynamically generated images are analysed to determine if the surface needs further application of LASER. The image data of the surface captured is stored in a .dat file. From this file, images are separated frame by frame and are displayed. \
The data stored in .dat files is of 'int16' format. The Matplotlib library has been used to display the images in RGB format.
